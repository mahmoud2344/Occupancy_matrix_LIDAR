# Occupancy_matrix_LIDAR
Overview
A real-time navigation system leveraging LIDAR sensor to map surroundings and guide autonomous movement.

Why (Problem)
Traditional autonomous systems often struggle in dynamic or unstructured environments. There was a need for a low-cost, adaptable system capable of interpreting LIDAR data for safe path planning.

Implementation
I processed LIDAR inputs to construct occupancy matrices and detect obstacles. A real-time path-planning algorithm was developed to adjust routes on-the-fly based on environmental data.

Result
The system successfully demonstrated autonomous navigation through complex paths with dynamic obstacle handling.

Conclusion
This project validated the feasibility of using real-time LIDAR data for precise navigation, paving the way for scalable robotics or autonomous vehicle applications.
